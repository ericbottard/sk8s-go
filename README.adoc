= SK8S Go Playground

Go experiments for https://github.com/markfisher/sk8s

== Building
These instructions assume you've cloned this repo in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/sk8s`:

[source, bash]
----
go install github.com/sk8s/controller/topic
----

== Running
To run from your machine targeting a k8s cluster you can manage with `kubectl`:
[source, bash]
----
$GOPATH/bin/topic -kubeconf ~/.kube/config
----

== Running in Cluster
To run the topic-controller _inside_ the Kubernetes Cluster

1. Build for Linux and create a Docker image with the executable:
+
[source, bash]
----
./dockerize.sh
----
2. The built image uses `sk8s/topic-controller:v0001` as the tag,
so https://github.com/markfisher/sk8s/blob/master/config/topic-controller-deployment.yaml[topic-controller-deployment.yaml] can be used.
